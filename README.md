# UNRAVEL_Chip-seq

this github contains: 
 * ChIP-seq workflow:
    - a .ga file for import to other Galaxy servers
    - a .svg image of the workflow 
 * Explanation on how to enter the VM
 * How to install tools on the UNRAVEL Galaxy


To have access to the Local UNRAVEL Galaxy workspace make an mydre account and request access from one of the owners. 
For analysis turn on one of the Windows VMs and the CentOS VM, but only enter the Windows VM. You can find galaxy on the desktop.
